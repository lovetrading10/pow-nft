# DAO Contribution Proof-Of-Work NFT ü¶ç

## Problem Statement

DAOs with a large contributor base is hard to manage! Contributors have limited ways to show work on-chain and in a easily discoverable way. At the same time, onboarding new contributors is a hard problem.

## Summary

Here we introduce a NFT issuance contract as well as periphery membership directories. The NFT issuer (could be community nominated) reviews proposals from contributors about their past work experience. 

Once the issuer (or a group of issuers) goes over the work and verifies it together, potentially through voting or signing messages or via multisig, they collectively mint the NFT using the tip the contributor included and issue them. Contributor receives an NFT for their work that's easy to showcase in their wallet. In the future, these work NFTs can be indexed via a subgraph to centralize the discoverability experience for DAO managers when they look for talent.

## Future plans

We're currently exploring a few ideas around staking and credit
- Can NFTs that represent work allow workes to get better loans from treasuries? Can work be a proxy for credit?
- How can we build a standard that's cross DAO compatible? 
- Could ISA type mechanisms be implemented through staking into the NFTs?
